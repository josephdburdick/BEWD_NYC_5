##Resources: Models & Active Record

###Cheat Sheet

####Create Models

```bash
	rails g model ModelName attribute_name:migration_type attribute_2:migration_type 
```
*	Use spaces to separate attributes. If you don't list a migration_type (text, integer, float, etc.) the default will be string.
####Migrations

__Migrations__

*	Forgot an attribute / field in your model? Create a migration
	*	Code below adds a field called ratings to the Movies model.

```bash
	rails g migration AddRatingToMovies rating:integer
```

__Seed Files__

*	Populating an entire database with the console would take a while. Use the seeds.rb file.

```bash
rake db:seed
```

__Drop The Database__

*	_You will loose your data if you do this._

```bash
	rake db:drop
```

__Drop database, run migrations, run seeds__

```bash
	rake db:reset
```

####Active Record

__Create__

	```ruby
		Movie.create(title: "Jaws")
	```

__Read__

	```ruby
		Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
	```
	
	```ruby
		# Returns all movie objects in an array.
		Movie.all
	```

__Update__

	```ruby
		jaws = Movie.find_by title: "Jaws"
		jaws.update description: "Big Shark, bites people"
	```

__Delete__

	```ruby
		jaws.destroy
	```


###Still Feel Lost? 

At the end of this course you should have an understanding of what databases are and the general structure of a database table (rows and colums). In addition you should be familiar with how to create, update and delete records using active record in the Rails console.
